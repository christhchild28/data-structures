# Initial Setup

Create a new [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository and name it `data-structures`  
All of your work for this class should be kept in this (well-organized!) repository.

1. Using Node.js (in Cloud 9), make a request for each of the ten "Meeting List Agenda" pages for Manhattan. **Important: show the code for all ten requests.**    
```
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m01.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m02.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m03.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m04.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m05.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m06.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m07.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m08.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m09.html  
https://parsons.nyc/aa/m10.html   
```

2. Using Node.js: For each of the ten files you requested, save the body as a **text file** to your "local" environment (either on your own laptop or in AWS Cloud9).

3. Study the HTML structure and tags and begin to think about how you might parse these files to extract relevant data for these AA meetings.

4. Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files: your `js` file and ten `txt` files. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository. 

## Starter code

```javascript
// npm install request
// mkdir data

var request = require('request');
var fs = require('fs');

request('https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2018/', function(error, response, body){
    if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
        fs.writeFileSync('/home/ec2-user/environment/data/thesis.txt', body);
    }
    else {console.log("Request failed!")}
});
```
