Christian Theodore Data Structures, Weekly Assignment 3

**Learnings from Last Week**
Based on the in-class walk-through of the Week 2 Assigment starter code, I updated my script to do the following:
1. Using the <td> tag as a starting point, method chain to the HTML, then to the strings using the index to reference specific points in the table (the startign numbers of each address)
2. Used JSON.stringify(meetings) in order to cleanly save all addresses to an array that can be looped over for future use.
