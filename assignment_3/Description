# Weekly Assignment 3

### Due 9/28 at 2:00pm

In preparation for this assignment, [create a free account with Texas A&M GeoServices](https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Signup/). 

Continue work on the file you parsed in Weekly Assignment 2. If you haven't already, organize your data into a [JSON format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) so that it will be easier to access the data for your work on this assignment.  
[[GIST: pushing to an array](https://gist.github.com/aaronxhill/38067bb58805896fdbb5)]

Write a script that makes a request to the [Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoding APIs](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/WebService/) for each address, using the address data you parsed in Weekly Assignment 2. You'll need to do some work on the address data (using code!) to prepare them for the API queries. For example, the parsed value `50 Perry Street, Ground Floor,` should be modified to `50 Perry Street, New York, NY`. The addresses are messy and may yield weird results from the API response. Don't worry too much about this right now. But, start to think about it; in a later assignment we'll have to clean these up.  

Your final output should be a **file** that contains an **array** that contains an **object** for each meeting (which may or may not nest other arrays and objects). The array should have a length equal to the number of meetings. Each object should hold the relevant data for each meeting. For now, we're focusing on the addresses and geographic coordinates. An example:  
`[ { address: '63 Fifth Ave, New York, NY', 
latLong: { lat: 40.7353041, lng: -73.99413539999999 } }, 
{ address: '16 E 16th St, New York, NY', 
latLong: { lat: 40.736765, lng: -73.9919024 } },
{ address: '2 W 13th St, New York, NY', 
latLong: { lat: 40.7353297, lng: -73.99447889999999 } } ]`

Be mindful of:  
* API rate limits (you get 2,500 requests total before needing to pay TAMU for more)  
* Asyncronous JavaScript (but don't overuse `setTimeout`)  
* Keeping your API key(s) off of GitHub (use a Linux environment variable instead)  
* Keeping only the data you need from the API response, not all the data  

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository. 

## Starter Code

### Setting environment variables in Linux

Environment variables on Linux help keep APIs secret (and off of GitHub!).  Here's a way to create a new environment variable in each session (in the Linux terminal in Cloud9): 

```
export NEW_VAR="Content of NEW_VAR variable"
printenv | grep NEW_VAR
```

Now you can use the environment variable in Node.js with `process.env`:

```javascript
var newVar = process.env.NEW_VAR;
```

However, this creates an ephemeral variable on Linux, which means you'll have to periodically recreate the variable. There are also [ways to create permanent environment variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). 

### Node.js script

```javascript
var request = require('request'); // npm install request
var async = require('async'); // npm install async
var fs = require('fs');

var apiKey = process.env.TAMU_KEY; 

var meetingsData = [];
var addresses = ["63 Fifth Ave", "16 E 16th St", "2 W 13th St"];

// eachSeries in the async module iterates over an array and operates on each item in the array in series
async.eachSeries(addresses, function(value, callback) {
    var apiRequest = 'https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/WebService/GeocoderWebServiceHttpNonParsed_V04_01.aspx?';
    apiRequest += 'streetAddress=' + value.split(' ').join('%20');
    apiRequest += '&city=New%20York&state=NY&apikey=' + apiKey;
    apiRequest += '&format=json&version=4.01';
    
    request(apiRequest, function(err, resp, body) {
        if (err) {throw err;}
        else {
            var tamuGeo = JSON.parse(body);
            console.log(tamuGeo['FeatureMatchingResultType']);
            meetingsData.push(tamuGeo);
        }
    });
    setTimeout(callback, 2000);
}, function() {
    fs.writeFileSync('first.json', JSON.stringify(meetingsData));
    console.log('*** *** *** *** ***');
    console.log('Number of meetings in this zone: ');
    console.log(meetingsData.length);
});
```
